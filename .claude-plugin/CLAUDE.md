# authcurl Claude Code Plugin

This plugin teaches Claude Code how to use, install, and configure `authcurl`.

When a user mentions authcurl, curl authentication, API auth headers, or asks how to make authenticated HTTP requests from the CLI, load the `skills/authcurl` skill.

The skill covers installation, config format, all three auth types (bearer, headers, basic), env var usage, and troubleshooting.
